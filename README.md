# INTERACTIVE-FRONTEND PROJECT

This application project is for to find hotels and limited to in any city in Turkey, Ireland, France, UK for now 
to be cost effective for me as Google Maps changed the policy.



## UX

In the dropdown search, the user can search any country and then by choosing a city it shows the hotels with the green markers.

The Web app is divided into three sections;

Upper half is for search section where the second bottom shows the conutry choosen. After the search query is made below the map of city chosen, it shows the hotels.


# Features Left to Implement:

The weather app will be implemented according to the city chosen later on with 3 days forecast.


# Technologies Used

Bootstrap 3.3.7 (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) is used for the design and Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)is used to show the hotels.

# Possible Bugs:


Also, I had issues with Ad Block when using Firefox where markers did not show up.
